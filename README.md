# OSPF-Multi-Area-Network-Design
A CCNA-level project showcasing OSPF Multi-Area routing architecture with Area 0 backbone and multiple non-backbone areas configuration, neighbor adjacency, and inter-area routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Multi-Area OSPF network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The design follows OSPF best practices by separating the network into multiple areas to improve scalability and performance.

## Key Concepts Covered
- OSPF Multi-Area Architecture
- Area 0 (Backbone Area)
- Inter-Area Routing
- OSPF Neighbor Adjacency
- Route Propagation between Areas

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routing Protocol: OSPF

## Network Design
- Area 0 (Backbone)
- Multiple non-backbone areas connected to Area 0
- Proper OSPF configuration on all routers

## Screenshots
Topology, OSPF neighbors, and routing tables are included in the screenshots folder.

## Outcome
- Successful OSPF adjacency formation
- Correct inter-area route exchange
- Stable and scalable network design
